        <h3>The BLISS-M Compiler Project</h3>

<h3>What is BLISS?</h3>

<p>The BLISS language was developed at Carnegie-Mellon University in the 1970's for systems programming.  It was adopted and used extensively by Digital Equipment Corporation for development of systems software across their 16-bit, 32-bit, 36-bit, and 64-bit systems.  It is a typeless, block-structured, language with an extensive lexical processing (macro) facility.  See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLISS">Wikipedia article on BLISS</a> for more information about the language.</p>

<h3>What is BLISS-M?</h3>

<p>BLISS-M (the <strong>M</strong> for multi-target) is a compiler for BLISS that runs on modern systems.  The front end is written in C, and should be portable to a wide variety of hosts.  The initial back end code generation support uses <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> as its intermediate representation, but should be extendable to other IRs for other platforms.</p>

<h3>Why a BLISS compiler?</h3>

<p>My main reasons for starting this project, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>I used to read and write a lot of BLISS code back when my main job involved software development for DEC VMS systems.  There were aspects of the language I really liked, particularly for low-level systems software, and I wanted to have a way to experiment around with using BLISS for more modern systems.</li>
<li>I have been thinking about starting some projects involving older microprocessors, and I thought BLISS could be a good language for cross-development on those CPUs, instead of coding everything in assembly language.</li>
<li>I have never written a compiler before, and was interested in learning more about compiler design and implementation.</li>
</ul><h3>Current status</h3>

<p>The compiler is a work-in-progress, and is not yet ready for general release.  Sources are available <a href="https://github.com/madisongh/blissc">here on GitHub</a> under a BSD 2-clause license.  See the <a href="https://github.com/madisongh/blissc/blob/master/README.md">README</a> in the source repository for the latest status information.  You can also use the issue tracker and visit <a href="https://github.com/madisongh/blissc/wiki">the wiki</a> for additional information.</p>
