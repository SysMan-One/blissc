{"name":"The BLISS-M Compiler Project","tagline":"A portable, multi-target BLISS compiler","body":"### The BLISS-M Compiler Project\r\n\r\n### What is BLISS?\r\nThe BLISS language was developed at Carnegie-Mellon University in the 1970's for systems programming.  It was adopted and used extensively by Digital Equipment Corporation for development of systems software across their 16-bit, 32-bit, 36-bit, and 64-bit systems.  It is a typeless, block-structured, language with an extensive lexical processing (macro) facility.  See the [Wikipedia article on BLISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLISS) for more information about the language.\r\n\r\n### What is BLISS-M?\r\nBLISS-M (the __M__ for multi-target) is a compiler for BLISS that runs on modern systems.  The front end is written in C, and should be portable to a wide variety of hosts.  The initial back end code generation support uses [LLVM](http://llvm.org) as its intermediate representation, but should be extendable to other IRs for other platforms.\r\n\r\n### Why a BLISS compiler?\r\nMy main reasons for starting this project, in no particular order:\r\n* I used to read and write a lot of BLISS code back when my main job involved software development for DEC VMS systems.  There were aspects of the language I really liked, particularly for low-level systems software, and I wanted to have a way to experiment around with using BLISS for more modern systems.\r\n* I have been thinking about starting some projects involving older microprocessors, and I thought BLISS could be a good language for cross-development on those CPUs, instead of coding everything in assembly language.\r\n* I have never written a compiler before, and was interested in learning more about compiler design and implementation.\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nThe compiler is a work-in-progress, and is not yet ready for general release.
